# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The latest patch version of the `3.x` release series is supported for security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

PHP_CodeSniffer is a developer tool and should generally not be used in a production (web accessible) environment.

Having said that, responsible disclosure of security issues is highly appreciated.

**Please do not report or discuss security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Issues can be reported privately to the maintainers by opening a [Security vulnerability report](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/security/advisories/new).

### Preferences

* Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps and a clearly defined impact.
* Include the version number of the vulnerable package in your report.
* Fixes are most welcome.
    A private PR can be created from the security report to work on and discuss the patch.
