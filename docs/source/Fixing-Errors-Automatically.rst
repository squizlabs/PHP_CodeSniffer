Fixing Errors Automatically
===========================

PHP\_CodeSniffer is able to fix many errors and warnings automatically.
The ``diff`` report can be used to generate a diff that can be applied
using the ``patch`` command. Alternatively, the PHP Code Beautifier and
Fixer (``phpcbf``) can be used in place of ``phpcs`` to automatically
generate and apply the diff for you.

Screen-based reports, such as the
`full <https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Reporting#printing-full-and-summary-reports>`__,
`summary <https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Reporting#printing-full-and-summary-reports>`__
and
`source <https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Reporting#printing-a-source-report>`__
reports, provide information about how many errors and warnings are
found. If any of the issues can be fixed automatically by ``phpcbf``,
additional information will be printed:

::

    $ phpcs /path/to/code/myfile.php

    FILE: /path/to/code/myfile.php
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    FOUND 5 ERRORS AFFECTING 4 LINES
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     3 | ERROR | [x] TRUE, FALSE and NULL must be lowercase; expected "false" but
       |       |     found "FALSE"
     5 | ERROR | [x] Line indented incorrectly; expected at least 4 spaces, found 1
     8 | ERROR | [ ] Missing function doc comment

Printing a Diff Report
----------------------

PHP\_CodeSniffer can output a diff file that can be applied using the
``patch`` command. The suggested changes will fix some of the sniff
violations that are present in the source code. To print a diff report,
use the ``--report=diff`` command line argument. The output will look
like this:

::

    $ phpcs --report=diff /path/to/code

    --- /path/to/code/file.php
    +++ PHP_CodeSniffer
    @@ -1,8 +1,8 @@
     <?php
     
    -if ($foo === FALSE) {
    +if ($foo === false) {
    +    echo 'hi';
         echo 'hi';
    - echo 'hi';
     }
     
     function foo() {

Diff reports are more easily used when output to a file. They can then
be applied using the ``patch`` command:

::

    $ phpcs --report-diff=/path/to/changes.diff /path/to/code
    $ patch -p0 -ui /path/to/changes.diff
    patching file /path/to/code/file.php

Using the PHP Code Beautifier and Fixer
---------------------------------------

To automatically fix as many sniff violations as possible, use the
``phpcbf`` command in place of the ``phpcs`` command. While most of the
PHPCS command line arguments can be used by PHPCBF, some are specific to
reporting and will be ignored. Running PHPCBF with the ``-h`` or
``--help`` command line arguments will print a list of commands that
PHPCBF will respond to. The output of ``phpcbf -h`` is shown below.

::

    Usage: phpcbf [-nwli] [-d key[=value]]
        [--standard=<standard>] [--sniffs=<sniffs>] [--suffix=<suffix>]
        [--severity=<severity>] [--error-severity=<severity>] [--warning-severity=<severity>]
        [--tab-width=<tabWidth>] [--encoding=<encoding>]
        [--extensions=<extensions>] [--ignore=<patterns>] <file> ...
            -n            Do not fix warnings (shortcut for --warning-severity=0)
            -w            Fix both warnings and errors (on by default)
            -l            Local directory only, no recursion
            -i            Show a list of installed coding standards
            -d            Set the [key] php.ini value to [value] or [true] if value is omitted
            --help        Print this help message
            --version     Print version information
            --no-patch    Do not make use of the "diff" or "patch" programs
            <file>        One or more files and/or directories to fix
            <encoding>    The encoding of the files being fixed (default is iso-8859-1)
            <extensions>  A comma separated list of file extensions to fix
                          (only valid if fixing a directory)
            <patterns>    A comma separated list of patterns to ignore files and directories
            <sniffs>      A comma separated list of sniff codes to limit the fixes to
                          (all sniffs must be part of the specified standard)
            <severity>    The minimum severity required to fix an error or warning
            <standard>    The name or path of the coding standard to use
            <suffix>      Write modified files to a filename using this suffix
                          ("diff" and "patch" are not used in this mode)
            <tabWidth>    The number of spaces each tab represents

When using the PHPCBF command, you do not need to specify a report type.
PHPCBF will automatically produce a diff file and apply it to your code
using the ``patch`` command:

::

    $ phpcbf /path/to/code
    Processing init.php [PHP => 7875 tokens in 960 lines]... DONE in 274ms (12 fixable violations)
        => Fixing file: 0/12 violations remaining [made 3 passes]... DONE in 412ms
    Processing config.php [PHP => 8009 tokens in 957 lines]... DONE in 421ms (155 fixable violations)
        => Fixing file: 0/155 violations remaining [made 7 passes]... DONE in 937ms
    Patched 2 files
    Time: 2.55 secs, Memory: 25.00Mb

    If you do not have access to the diff or patch commands within your
    development environment, specify the ``--no-patch`` command line
    argument. PHPCBF will use PHP to replace the content of your files.

    ::

        $ phpcbf /path/to/code --no-patch
        Processing init.php [PHP => 7875 tokens in 960 lines]... DONE in 274ms (12 fixable violations)
            => Fixing file: 0/12 violations remaining [made 3 passes]... DONE in 412ms
            => File was overwritten
        Processing config.php [PHP => 8009 tokens in 957 lines]... DONE in 421ms (155 fixable violations)
            => Fixing file: 0/155 violations remaining [made 7 passes]... DONE in 937ms
            => File was overwritten
        Fixed 2 files
        Time: 2.55 secs, Memory: 25.00Mb

If you do not want to overwrite existing files, you can specify the
``--suffix`` command line argument and provide a filename suffix to use
for new files. A fixed copy of each file will be created and stored in
the same directory as the original file. If a file already exists with
the new name, it will be overwritten.

::

    $ phpcbf /path/to/code --suffix=.fixed
    Processing init.php [PHP => 7875 tokens in 960 lines]... DONE in 274ms (12 fixable violations)
        => Fixing file: 0/12 violations remaining [made 3 passes]... DONE in 412ms
        => Fixed file written to init.php.fixed
    Processing config.php [PHP => 8009 tokens in 957 lines]... DONE in 421ms (155 fixable violations)
        => Fixing file: 0/155 violations remaining [made 7 passes]... DONE in 937ms
        => Fixed file written to config.php.fixed
    Fixed 2 files
    Time: 2.55 secs, Memory: 25.00Mb

    When using the ``--suffix`` command line argument, the ``diff`` and
    ``patch`` commands are not used so you don't need to specify the
    ``--no-patch`` argument.

Viewing Debug Information
-------------------------

To see the fixes that are being made to a file, specify the ``-vv``
command line argument when generating a diff report. There is quite a
lot of debug output concerning the standard being used and the
tokenizing of the file, but the end of the output will look like this:

::

    $ phpcs /path/to/file --report=diff -vv
    ..snip..
    *** START FILE FIXING ***
    E: [Line 3] Expected 1 space after "="; 0 found (Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing.NoSpaceAfter)
    Squiz_Sniffs_WhiteSpace_OperatorSpacingSniff (line 259) replaced token 4 (T_EQUAL) "=" => "=·"
    * fixed 1 violations, starting loop 2 *
    *** END FILE FIXING ***

Sometimes the file may need to be processed multiple times in order to
fix all the violations. This can happen when multiple sniffs need to
modify the same part of a file, or if a fix causes a new sniff violation
somewhere else in the standard. When this happens, the output will look
like this:

::

    $ phpcs /path/to/file --report=diff -vv
    ..snip..
    *** START FILE FIXING ***
    E: [Line 3] Expected 1 space before "="; 0 found (Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing.NoSpaceBefore)
    Squiz_Sniffs_WhiteSpace_OperatorSpacingSniff (line 228) replaced token 3 (T_EQUAL) "=" => "·="
    E: [Line 3] Expected 1 space after "="; 0 found (Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing.NoSpaceAfter)
    * token 3 has already been modified, skipping *
    E: [Line 3] Equals sign not aligned correctly; expected 1 space but found 0 spaces (Generic.Formatting.MultipleStatementAlignment.Incorrect)
    * token 3 has already been modified, skipping *
    * fixed 1 violations, starting loop 2 *
    E: [Line 3] Expected 1 space after "="; 0 found (Squiz.WhiteSpace.OperatorSpacing.NoSpaceAfter)
    Squiz_Sniffs_WhiteSpace_OperatorSpacingSniff (line 259) replaced token 4 (T_EQUAL) "=" => "=·"
    * fixed 1 violations, starting loop 3 *
    *** END FILE FIXING ***
