Requirements
============

PHP\_CodeSniffer requires PHP version 5.1.2 or greater, although
individual sniffs may have additional requirements such as external
applications and scripts. See the [[Configuration Options]] manual page
for a list of these requirements.

The SVN pre-commit hook requires PHP version 5.2.4 or greater due to its
use of the vertical whitespace character.
