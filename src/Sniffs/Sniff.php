     * A sniff can acquire information this token, along with all the other
     * tokens within the stack by first acquiring the token stack:
     *
     * <code>
     *    $tokens = $phpcsFile->getTokens();

     *
     * If the sniff discovers an anomaly in the code, they can raise an error
     * by calling addError() on the \PHP_CodeSniffer\Files\File object, specifying an error
     * message and the position of the offending token:
     *
     * <code>
     *    $phpcsFile->addError('Encountered an error', $stackPtr);
     * </code>
     *
     * @param \PHP_CodeSniffer\Files\File $phpcsFile The PHP_CodeSniffer file where the
     *                                               token was found.
     * @param int                         $stackPtr  The position in the PHP_CodeSniffer
     *                                               file's token stack where the token
     *                                               was found.
     *
     * @return void|int Optionally returns a stack pointer. The sniff will not be
     *                  called again on the current file until the returned stack
     *                  pointer is reached. Return (count($tokens) + 1) to skip
     *                  the rest of the file.
